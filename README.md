# Text Classification Using Naive Bayes
In this project Multinomial Naive Bayes(sklearn's MultinomialNB as well as Multinomial Naive Bayes implemented from scratch) has been used for text classification using python 3. <br />
Dataset available at - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups <br />
Given a text document we aim to predict the news group category (out of the the 20 given categories) it belongs to. <br />
(If you want quicker run time you can change the directory from 20_newsgroups to mini_newsgroups which consists of a smaller dataset) <br /> <br />
## Features 
You can fit the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier over the training data, make predictions and get the score(mean accuracy) for testing data. <br />
Our model gives similar results on comparison with sklearn's MultinomialNB. <br />
The model has been trained on 15,000 documents and 5,000 articles have been used for testing purposes.
